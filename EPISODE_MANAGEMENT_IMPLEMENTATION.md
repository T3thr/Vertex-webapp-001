# Episode Management Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive episode management system for the BlueprintTab that allows each episode to have its own independent nodes and edges (StoryMap).

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Episode Management Modal** (`EpisodeManagementModal.tsx`)
- **Visual Overview**: Grid and list view of all episodes
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete episodes directly from the modal
- **Episode Metadata**: 
  - Title, order, volume number
  - Status (draft, published, scheduled, archived)
  - Access type (free, paid, premium)
  - Pricing for paid episodes
- **Search & Sort**: Filter episodes by name, sort by order or date
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant synchronization with database

### 2. **Database Integration**
- **Separate StoryMaps**: Each episode has its own independent StoryMap stored in the database
- **API Routes**:
  - `/api/novels/[slug]/episodes` - CRUD operations for episodes
  - `/api/novels/[slug]/episodes/[episodeId]/storymap` - Load episode-specific StoryMap
  - `/api/novels/[slug]/episodes/[episodeId]/storymap/save` - Save episode StoryMap
- **Data Persistence**: All episode data and their StoryMaps are saved to MongoDB

### 3. **BlueprintTab Integration**
- **Episode Management Button**: Added "จัดการตอน" button in the floating toolbar
- **Episode Selector**: Dropdown to switch between episodes
- **Add Episode Button**: Quick access to create new episodes
- **Automatic StoryMap Loading**: When switching episodes, the corresponding StoryMap is loaded

## 🔄 How It Works

### Creating a New Episode
1. User clicks "จัดการตอน" (Manage Episodes) button
2. Modal opens showing all existing episodes
3. User clicks "เพิ่มตอนใหม่" (Add New Episode)
4. Fills in episode details (title, order, status, etc.)
5. Episode is created in database with empty StoryMap
6. User is automatically switched to the new episode

### Switching Between Episodes
1. User selects an episode from the dropdown or modal
2. Current StoryMap is cached (if modified)
3. Selected episode's StoryMap is loaded from database
4. Canvas updates to show the episode's nodes and edges
5. If no StoryMap exists, an empty canvas is shown

### Episode Independence
- Each episode has its own:
  - Set of nodes (scenes, choices, branches, etc.)
  - Set of edges (connections between nodes)
  - Story variables
  - Editor metadata (zoom level, position, etc.)
- No data is shared between episodes' StoryMaps

## 🎨 UI Components

### Episode Management Modal
- **Header**: Shows total episode count
- **Toolbar**: Search, sort, view mode toggle, add episode button
- **Episode Cards**: Display episode info with status badges
- **Form Modal**: Create/edit episode details
- **Footer Stats**: Summary of published/draft episodes

### BlueprintTab Integration
- **Floating Toolbar**: Episode selector and management buttons
- **Canvas Area**: Displays current episode's StoryMap
- **Properties Panel**: Edit selected nodes/edges

## 🔐 Security Features
- Authentication required for all operations
- Authorization checks (only authors/co-authors can manage)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations
- StoryMap caching to reduce database calls
- Lazy loading of episode data
- Debounced auto-save functionality
- Efficient state management with React hooks

## 📝 Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Open the Blueprint tab in your novel editor
2. Click "จัดการตอน" to see all episodes
3. Create new episodes or select existing ones
4. Each episode has its own canvas for story design
5. Changes are saved automatically or manually

### For Developers
```typescript
// Create a new episode
const response = await fetch(`/api/novels/${slug}/episodes`, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    title: 'Episode 1',
    episodeOrder: 1,
    status: 'draft',
    accessType: 'free'
  })
});

// Load episode's StoryMap
const storyMap = await fetch(`/api/novels/${slug}/episodes/${episodeId}/storymap`);

// Save StoryMap changes
await fetch(`/api/novels/${slug}/episodes/${episodeId}/storymap/save`, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    nodes: [...],
    edges: [...],
    storyVariables: [...]
  })
});
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- Each episode MUST have its own StoryMap
- Episodes are NOT sharing nodes/edges
- Deleting an episode also removes its StoryMap
- Episode order must be unique within a novel

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- [ ] Bulk episode operations (delete multiple, reorder)
- [ ] Episode templates for quick creation
- [ ] Import/export episode StoryMaps
- [ ] Episode analytics and statistics
- [ ] Collaborative editing per episode
- [ ] Version control for episode StoryMaps
